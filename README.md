# A Novel Log-Normal Distribution

## 📄 Overview
This repository contains the research paper **“A Novel Log-Normal Distribution: Simulation, Applications to Mechanical Component Data and Environmental Data”**, authored by **Mahfooz Alam and Sanjana Sharma**.

The paper introduces a **three-parameter Weighted Log-Normal (WLN) distribution**, extending the classical log-normal model to improve flexibility and goodness-of-fit for real-world data.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Propose a new extension of the log-normal distribution  
- Derive key statistical properties including PDF, CDF, survival and hazard functions  
- Study quantile functions, moments, skewness, and kurtosis  
- Estimate model parameters using **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**  
- Validate estimator performance through **Monte Carlo simulation**  
- Apply the model to **mechanical component failure data** and **environmental datasets**

---

## 🧪 Methodology
- Mathematical formulation of the Weighted Log-Normal (WLN) distribution  
- Analytical derivation of distributional properties  
- Parameter estimation using **L-BFGS-B optimization** via `scipy.optimize.minimize` (Python)  
- Simulation studies based on bias, standard error, and mean squared error  
- Model comparison using **AIC, BIC, AICC, HQIC**, and **Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests**

---

## 📊 Applications
The proposed WLN distribution is evaluated using:
- Mechanical component lifetime data  
- Environmental measurement datasets  
- Reliability engineering and survival analysis scenarios  

Across all datasets, the WLN model demonstrates **superior empirical fit** compared to standard alternatives.
